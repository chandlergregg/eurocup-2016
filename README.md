# eurocup-2016
Repository for solutions to Eurocup 2016 SQL practice project as part of Springboard Data Engineering program.

To run queries, import the data in the `eurocup-2016-csv-data` into a MySQL database. Then, run the SQL queries against the database. The `sql_all_problems.sql` file contains answers to all problems, while the other numbered files are for individual questions.

## Note

Data should be imported into a schema called `euro_cup_2016`. When running individual SQL files, make sure to run `USE euro_cup_2016` to avoid adding the schema name to each table.
